# City Intelligence System
#
# A command line agent that answers questions about the weather and the latest
# news for a city. It uses a Groq-hosted LLM, the OpenWeather API for weather,
# the Tavily API for news, and a human approval step before every tool call.

# Load environment variables from a .env file before anything reads them.
# Required keys: GROQ_API_KEY, OPENWEATHER_API_KEY, TAVILY_API_KEY
